As a data science student preparing to enter the job market, I was curious about programming languages and whether I needed to know a little bit of various languages/what companies anticipate from job seekers, given the dataset. The science of data Job postings -Australia in 2019-2021 will be used to answer questions that I wanted to know but didn't want to ask, such as: 

• Which industries are data scientists most happy in?  

• What do data scientists make?  

• Can I work as a data scientist in Australia if I am from another country? 

## This dataset is great for:

Text analysis / NLP (see the Job Description column),
Geospatial analysis (every job has a location)
Visualisation
Note that this dataset is very beginner-friendly, but also has some challenging wrangling to keep advanced scientists challenged and entertained.

## Inspiration

This dataset is inspired by a desire to know more about the world we live in.
