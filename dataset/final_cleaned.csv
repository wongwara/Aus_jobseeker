        and size by using insurance based modelling and machine learning. Your work will involve covering strategic and experimental approaches to modelling and optimisation and analysing variables like future vehicle technologies and risks to underwriting
        through the use of scenario and time series modelling.This environment is rich in data and you will be essentially looking at how machine learning modelling in an artificial intelligence framework can be used in insurance modelling. The role
        is heavily technical and you will be working with large data sets to price individual premiums.In addition to the technical piece, you will be required to think for yourself in this role, work on solving business problems and be able
        to deal with the unknown from time to time. As part of the Strategic Pricing Analytics team, you will be working with the most technically challenging pieces in the business. The four algorithms used in the team are neural networks, gradient boosting,
        random forest and elastic net general linear modelling (GLM). There will be lots of white paper research involved and applying business problems to the algorithms. There are plenty of opportunities for career development technically
        and on the business side. The majority of your responsibilities initially will be around data preparation, data engineering and programming. Attitude is a huge part of this role. Appetite and desire is more important than work history.SKILLS & EXPERIENCEProgramming skills in tools like SAS, SQL or R
          Strong mathematics or programming background
          Passionate about Data Science and Machine Learning
          Advantageous to have exposure to Actuarial work
          Good communication skills

        Senior Data Scientist - NLP, Machine Learning and Automation
         
        Financial Markets Research
        Newly Created Team, Function and Product
        Up to $150,000
        This opportunity represents the best of all worlds. It’s a new team tasked with creating a new product that automates one of the core revenue producing products across this financial services specialist. This is start-up team, but not in a lean start-up. The firm has a 20 years history and is well funded.
        No one in the firm has built anything like this before, so you won’t have to contend with half-finished code, a product that doesn’t work or other people’s ideas how what and how to do ‘it’. You are Year Zero, the bridge between Anno Domini and BC, the ‘Big before the ‘Bang’.
         
        Your sole purpose will be to research best ways to model business problems using the mass of inhouse (textual and numerical) data, investigate appropriate methods to transform the data for modelling purposes and create models. These models and predictions will then be sold to every major financial services house in Australia and New Zealand. 
         
        NLP
        The product will be a model that produces recommendations for future performance (human and numerical) based on past information. The use of NLP is key due to nuanced language that needs to be matrixed in order to produce useful signals. You will work alongside a senior data engineer (also being recruited). 
         
        Machine Learning
        There’s almost 20 years of data that can be used. Your knowledge of supervised (or unsupervised) learning algorithms, Reinforced learning and Regressions will be key. 
         
        The Tech
        AWS
          R or/and Python
          BI Tools – whatever you want to use
         
        You’ll need decent. coding experience and the understanding of good engineering practises and producing visualisations. BI tools, ideally experience of working with document databases and graph databases is essential.
        Leadership is provided by the Head of Team, but everything else is down to you. If you are looking to just ‘go forth and create’ and enjoy being an intellectual leader and a some who ‘does the work’, then get in contact.

        This is an ideal role for a skilled Data Scientist that wants to experience less of a hands-on programming role. In this role you will not only be part of a Data Science team, but also be the conduit between tech/analytics and the rest of the business.
        Client Details
        You will be working closely with a Senior Data Science Manager within a critical government entity based within Sydney CBD.
        This organisation is well into their Data Science journey, and is constantly growing their analytics capability and adding new technology to their bow.
        In this role you will receive excellent coaching and training and preparation for more senior leadership positions.
        Description
        I'm looking for a skilled Analytics/Data Science mind to be able to influence, provide hands-on expertise, and ensure successful delivery of projects.
        You will be working closely with the Data Science team, but also with other parts of the business that are less literate when it comes to analytics.
        This is not for someone that purely wants to build models and “practice data science”, but more for someone that can leverage their mixture of analytics skills. At this senior level, you will need to be flexible to mould to the business's requirements as and when complications arise.

596,2,1,,2,120000,140000,0,"This is a mid-level Data Scientist opening within a very cool, high-impact strategy team part of a large ASX-listed company with millions of customers. For a junior-mid level data scientist, you would have amazing exposure to a strong mentor (lead data scientist), opportunities to work with cutting-edge big data and cloud tech (Apache Spark, GCP, dbt, Python, Airflow, etc) and importantly, solve challenging problems.      What does the team look like? This is a 4-5 person squad and you will work with a Lead Data Scientist, Senior Analyst & Data Visualisation specialist. There is a separate sister data science team who focus on customer loyalty, advertising, digital and e-commerce projects.      What kind of work does the team do? A mix of greenfield data science projects, ad hoc requests and projects and building and maintaining data science products. There is also a view that most, or all your work should be explainable. Not every project will be a huge ML model as sometimes you are answering critical or urgent questions for executive decisions, but these problems will tend to be very interesting and if there was not a key statistical or data science requirement, we wouldn’t be working on it.      What are some examples of projects I would work on?There is a new model being built to help solve challenging problems across different sites; how do we model the amount and shapes of retail space in each site and optimise this for new clients? Another project is helping migrate from Quantium transaction data (NAB) to the new Commbank IQ transaction data. Another stream of early work is exploring use of video data for analytics and insights to understand movement patterns       What skills and academic background is required for this data science role?A strong maths and statistics background is required – including ability to apply scientific thinking and experimentation to data. This would include an academic background such as a Masters or PhD level in a data science related field Good Python skills are required (we assume you have decent SQL or R also) as you will need to use various modelling packages, write scripts, contribute production-grade code and connect and integrate various cloud and big data services (they use Apache Spark and GCP – Google Cloud Platform) Confidence and strong communication skills with business stakeholders. This would extend beyond working with data peers to explaining models and advanced concepts to senior executives and workshopping ideas in cross-functional teams.       What would the first 6 months look like? Realistically, your first 6 months will include learning a lot about the existing software and data environment, Machine Learning pipelines, existing codebase and helping maintain, de-bug and productionise some models. There are some fairly large, complex models and it will be beneficial for you to understand these well (and also get to know the business!) before building greenfield data science products.    After 6 months is where you will start to see more interesting work and take some ownership of end-to-end solutions.      What kind of tools and tech stack will I work with on the job? The team currently use a lot of; Google BigQuery, Python, R, SQL, Airflow, Spark, dbt. Professional experience with more of these will help your application.    That said, this team works on solving questions that have not been solved before, so new innovative technologies will always be encouraged and adopted. It will help if you are motivated self-learner who enjoys exploring new tools and is happy to make recommendations to the team.      You haven’t mentioned reporting, BI and data visualization – is that part of the job? It may be a small portion, however, there is a visualization expert in the team and also other teams of BI and reporting specialists that handle normal or BAU work in this space.      Does this hire favour a data scientist from a Maths OR Programming background? Ideally some of both. The ability to work with big data, de-bug and contribute to production pipelines and understand concepts like scalability is important - so this won’t be a role where someone can learn Python on the job. If you come from a computer science or data mining background working in ML, then we will still need a strong analytical and statistical knowledge.

Ownership and lead responsibilities from day one on a major data science project Market leading insurance & financial org with millions of customers Within financial services, some data science and ML projects are limited by regulations, silos or other factors… this one has few of those issues and plenty of interesting use-cases for ML and automation! Strong data talent – you will have welcoming peers and support from a wide range of other data professionals in their niches (e.g. BI, data engineering, data analysts)   Location: Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane    Why does the role exist? It is newly created to help the team manager lead a critical data product – then move on to other data science projects.  What does the team look like?  The Advanced Analytics team is 9 people, based in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane. (There are over 100 other data professionals in the company in different areas.)   What is this team’s mission? You will be embedded with insurance, operations and claims teams and deliver data science and ML models, projects and automation to add business value and create better customer outcomes.   How much work is data science compared with other reporting, BI, data governance, etc? There are separate teams who specialise in reporting, BI and data governance. Your role is delivering end-to-end data science solutions with some data visualisation.   What is expected of a ‘Senior Data Scientist’ in this team?You will definitely have 4-5 years minimum of professional data science/advanced analytics experience. You are hands-on and technical, but also very proficient at managing end-to-end projects from requirement gathering and stakeholder management onwards. They expect standard DS skills; SQL, Python, managing and manipulating data, modelling skills, what ML models to evaluate then build and how to help end-users get value from them. Being able to engage and present complex topics to non-technical audiences is key.  What are some examples of projects I would work on? The immediate focus is an exciting data science + automation project with an expected large impact to the business Insurance claim fraud detection Working with stakeholders and running data experiments, proposing new data science projects This role is in Insurance, am I doing actuarial/pricing models? No.  What is the approach to Hybrid work? This role can be based in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane and the view would be a flexible 1-2 days per week from the office once it is Covid safe. Focus is on outcomes.  How much time is spent in deep technical work vs everything else?  While this person needs very solid data science and ML foundations, it is not a hardcore style of Data Science-ML Engineer position where you are working on code all day. Solving problems and the entire end-to-end solution lifecycle are important.    What domain experience and commercial industry experience is required? Knowledge of Insurance Claims is a huge advantage and desirable. After that, broader knowledge of financial services is a next best. We would not rule out a strong candidate who has come from other areas though, such as machine learning in; retail, telco, banking, e-commerce.  What tools and data stack will I work with on the job?   AWS and Domino data lab Python SQL AWS Redshift Tableau    How does the Data & Analytics Maturity compare to the industry? Quite mature – this company has been on their data science journey for 4-5 years and data scientists are generally looking for ways to deploy/productionise and automate models in AWS without huge efforts going from POC to prod like some standard teams in Australia. Stakeholders in an insurance business are also naturally data driven.   What is the salary on offer?  $130K - $145K including super, with bonus on top",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,"(130000.0, 140000.0]",4.0
